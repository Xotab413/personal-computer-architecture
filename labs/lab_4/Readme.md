I choose to play [Bohemian Rapsody](https://sheetmusic-free.com/bohemian-rhapsody-sheet-music-queen-7512/), not all, but some piece of its, and, yeah, i have musician education ( 9 year on accrodion), and that's why i know note, and other thing.

Every note has own tone (frequence) and duration (speed)
<br> That's why you need to convert your note to frequence 

  - Ликбез on note's grammar: 
    - [One](https://pereborom.ru/dlitelnosti-not/)
    - [Two](https://lovec-not.ru/blog/dlitelnosti-not)
  - Converter notes to frequence
    - Simple [toneGenerator](https://www.ural-auto.ru/services/tone-generator/)
    - Advance [freq calculator](https://www.translatorscafe.com/unit-converter/ru-RU/calculator/note-frequency/), which i use
    - Another [one](https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/)
    - [Converting note](http://www.jacklinstudios.com/software/notefreq/NoteFreq.wdgt/index.html) to freq, maybe , you can write programm that set note name to 1-st Edit-Text, and get result 
> You can also parse midi to text, and get our values

## Material that's insipred me
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4SGAA3A2RY) of OP's Developer with best practise of C
- [Good post](https://learn.digilentinc.com/Documents/392) with clear code, but they use Piezoelectric Buzzer, i think, it's doesn't matter
- [Conver Midi to NumPy array](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/convert-midi-file-to-numpy-array-in-python-7d00531890c), mb it's will be interesting for PYthonist
- Interesting [video](https://youtu.be/NIyQueXqRYE) about PC-Speaker
- [History](https://youtu.be/Uh7KGPOC8gc) of PC-Speaker
